## Intro

This repo includes

- slides of **basicRL** tutorials made by Judy
- reading notes and some python implementations from **Reinforcement Learning an Introduction 2nd Edition** by Sutton and Barto
- some interesting extensions and papers throughout the reading

Here is a detailed note of **basicRL**:

Let me know if you found any typo or mistakes :)

## Contents of Slides

**basicRL_1** - explanations of basic RL concepts like agent-environment interactions, (discrete/continuous) states, (discrete/continuous) actions, (the art of) rewards, (deterministic/stochastic) policies, (deterministic/stochastic) dynamics, and MDP

**basicRL_2** - explanations of the goal of RL, with ingredients like episode, history trajectory, return, discounting factor, value functions, optimal value functions and optimal policy
